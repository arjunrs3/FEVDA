### Next Steps 
## Restructure software architecture
- delete unnecessary functions
- convert to explicit units instead of implicit units
- Reduce interdependencies between files of different hierarchies
## Document 
- generate proper documentation that is easy to read and understand
## Validate 
- validate methodology through unit testing physical relationships
- Maybe some car validation as well
- Specifically focus on engine validation
- Tire modeling relationships have already been validated, but create unit tests
## Ship 
- Ship to other Shell Eco Marathon teams
## Eco only: Sensitivity analysis 
## ask for help from other teams: 
- Fuel cell / electronics modeling
